            Born in the Outer Sunset, San Franpsycho originally began as a
            surfing film documenting the local Ocean Beach surf scene in 2001.
            After the film, fans identified with the name and demanded we make
            clothing. So we learned the art of screen-printing, creating various
            garments in a dark basement by night, and selling out of of an
            orange and black zebra-striped van named Big Chaos by day.
