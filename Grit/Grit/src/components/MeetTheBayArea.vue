          Born in the Outer Sunset, San Franpsycho originally began as a surfing
          film documenting the local Ocean Beach surf scene in 2001. After the
          film, fans identified with the name and demanded we make clothing. So
          we learned the art of screen-printing, creating various garments in a
          dark basement by night, and selling out of of an orange and black
          zebra-striped van named Big Chaos by day.
